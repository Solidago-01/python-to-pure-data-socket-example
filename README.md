# python-to-pure-data-socket-example
Demonstration of passing live integer stream from Python script to pure data patch. 
With both programs running, and the same socket number chosen for each ("port" in Python, and "netreceive" in Pure Data), 
Python will send a range of numbers that Pure Data will convert to a wind sound. This could easily be
edited to accommodate different behaviors. 

Intended for use with PD Vanilla. Pure Data is developed by Miller Puckette since 1996.
